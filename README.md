# JavaScript 30 Challenge 

This is a repo for Chegg's EasybibLabs team from CitationMachine + BibMe to work on JS challenges presented in https://javascript30.com/ 

Just for fun, to learn some up to date JS + CSS, newer browser API's etc.

You can watch the vid, and starter files are copied here.

Initialize the start files submodule with:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

To submit a solution, add the folder for the week's challenge, and submit a PR against master.
