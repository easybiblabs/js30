# JavaScript 30 Challenge 

This is a repo for Chegg's EasybibLabs team from CitationMachine + BibMe to work on JS challenges presented in https://javascript30.com/ 

Just for fun, to learn some up to date JS + CSS, newer browser API's etc.

To participate - visit the link above and create a free account.
You can watch the vid, and starter files are copied here.

Initialize the start files submodule with:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### To submit a solution

1.  Create a branch
1.  Copy the "index-start" file (or all files that we need to touch) to a `<your_name>.html`, ala `avi.html` 
1.  Make edits to that file and submit when ready

This way we can:

-  Still see the changes someone did to the initially supplied file
-  Merge all PRs in and keep a history of the solutions
